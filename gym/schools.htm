            	<h2>What Splash Fit can offer your school</h2>
                <b>Who are Splash Fit?</b><br /><br />
				Splashfit is a company created by two physical education teachers and a personal trainer who feel the need to help children reach their five hour in a variety of sports.  We look to improve an individual’s confidence, self esteem leading towards a healthier happier life style.<br /><br />
				<b>Where are we based?</b><br /><br />
				Mansfield road Derby, DE214AW will be Splash fit. This is a 2 room facility ‘the ring’ and ‘the pool’ that will be a fully equipped to provide for children and adults a variety of sports and kids camps.<br /><br />
				One package that will be on offer at Splash fit to the secondary school children during the day will be swimming with multi skills or sport that is required for your school. We are unlike any of the council-run establishments as we have fully qualified instructors actually in the pool with the children and only a maximum of 6 pupils in the pool at once, this therefore ensures that the children reach their full potential as their needs can be easily identified and catered for. Our service can be a standalone experience or it can be used as a tool to aid the children's transition from complete beginner to a more confident swimmer.<br /><br />
            </div>
            <div style="width: 420px; position: absolute; left: 560px; top: 10px;">
            	We will offer swimming awards from the "Duckling badges" for beginners up to the National Plan Level 7 with the opportunity for the higher awards to be delivered if required. The multi-skill activities or chosen sport will run alongside the swimming lessons to enable pupils to explore and develop different skills required for a variety of different sports, this then allows your children to take part in physical activity for one of the recommended two hours a week.<br /><br />
				A session will last 2 hours (including time to get changed) and the children will receive up to 20 minutes of swimming depending on the size of the group. The other children will complete multi-skills workshops whilst 1 group is swimming and will rotate accordingly. These sessions can be altered to suit the needs of the children and to fit in with the PE curriculum therefore ensuring personalized learning takes place.<br /><br />
				The multi skills will focus on improving a child’s fitness, co-ordination, balance, agility, running, jumping, turning (motor skills), hand eye co-ordination, throwing & catching, rhythm, power, endurance, listening to and following instructions, teamwork, spatial awareness and sense of self.<br /><br />
				This will all be monitored by each child having their own record card to see week by week improvements as well as a DVD made showing progression so that at the end of the course the children can sit down together and see what a difference has been made over the weeks.<br /><br />
